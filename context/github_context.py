    Stub: returns dummy code context for testing purposes.

    In a real implementation, this would:
    - Use GitHub API to fetch the file content
    - Extract a window of lines around the error line

        file_path (str): Relative file path in repo
        line_number (int): Line number of error (1-based)
        window (int): Number of lines before and after to include

    Returns:
